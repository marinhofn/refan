Addition of import statements for `android.support.v4.app.Fragment`, `CursorDragProcessor`, and `AngleUnitsChanger`.\n2. Introduction of a new method `getButton` to simplify finding views by ID.\n3. Reworking of the layout handling code to use the new `getButton` method and the updated `OnDragListenerVibrator` class.\n4. Modifications to the existing `CalculatorKeyboardFragment` class to accommodate these changes.\n\nClassification: diff_source=\"direct\"",

Modification of the layout of the XML files for various fragments (`CalculatorEditorFragment`, `CalculatorDisplayFragment`, and `CalculatorKeyboardFragment`) to accommodate the new behavioral changes, such as adding new buttons and changing the properties of existing ones.\n3. Addition of a new class `OnDragListenerVibrator` that wraps an existing `OnDragListener` and adds vibration effects when the button is dragged.\n4. Modification of the `CalculatorKeyboardFragment` class to accept a `Vibrator` object as an argument in its constructor, and use it to create vibration effects when dragging buttons.\n5. Addition of several new methods in the `CalculatorKeyboardFragment` class, such as `initHistoryButton`, `initSubtractionButton`, `initEqualsButton`, `initAngleUnitsButton`, `initClearButton`, `initVarsButton`, `initRoundBracketsButton`, and `initMultipl",

Addition of a new method called `redrawEmpty_()` in some JavaScript files (e.g., `zul/src/archive/web/js/zul/grid/Grid.js`, `zul/src/archive/web/js/zul/sel/Listbox.js`)\n5. Addition of a new property called `_shallFixEmpty` in the Java file (e.g., `zul/src/org/zkoss/zul/Grid.java`)\n6. Modification of the JavaScript CSS files to include Sass variables (e.g., `fontFamilyC`, `fontSizeM`)\n7. Addition of a new property called `_renderAll` in the Java file (e.g., `zul/src/org/zkoss/zul/Grid.java`)\n8. Modification of the JavaScript code to limit the maximum year value for date formatting (Bug B50-3288904)\n\nOverall, these changes seem to be focused on improving the maintainability and readability of the codebase by adding comments, documentation, and Sass variables. The addition of new methods and properties suggests that there might have been some refactoring or improvements made to the empty message handling in the grid and listbox components. However, without a more thorough analysis, it's difficult to determine if these changes result in any significant behavioral modifications.\n\nClassification: diff_source: \"direct\"",

Addition of new properties and roles for developer in pom.xml file.\n\nStructural changes include:\n1. Addition of new classes, methods, and properties in various java files related to Treerow and Treeitem.\n2. Modification in FileUploadDlg.zul file by adding new HTML elements and styles.\n3. Addition of new plugins in pom.xml file for generating javadoc with specific source and target versions.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n1. Behavioral changes: New methods, constructors, and properties added to existing classes.\n2. Structural changes: Addition of new files, classes, methods, and properties; modification in existing files.\n3. Impact on existing functionality: The deprecated methods are redundant with existing ones, so they might affect the compatibility for users who have been using these methods. However, the new constructors and methods should not significantly impact the existing functionality as they are optional additions.\n4.

These changes may affect the compatibility with other libraries or systems that rely on these versions.\n2. Addition of a new method `setServiceName(String serviceName)` in AdminServlet class which allows setting a service name if needed.

Addition of a new method `getButton` to retrieve a specific button view by its id.\n2. Modification of the code that sets the onDragListener for various buttons, such as historyButton, subtractionButton, rightButton, leftButton, equalsButton, angleUnitsButton, clearButton, varsButton, roundBracketsButton, and others. The new method `getButton` is used to retrieve these buttons instead of finding them directly in the root view.\n3. Addition of a new method `toggleButtonDirectionText` that toggles the visibility of direction text for certain buttons based on the provided dragDirections.\n\nThe structural changes include:\n1. Extraction of some code related to setting onDragListeners into separate methods, such as `setOnDragListeners`, `onDragListener`, and `toggleButtonDirectionText`.\n2. Addition of a new class `OnDragListenerVibrator` that wraps an OnDragListener with a Vibrator for haptic feedback.\n3.

In AdminServletTest, a mockito stub has been added for the HttpServletRequest object's getContextPath() method.

The contextPath variable in AdminServletTest is now set using Mockito when(), instead of being directly assigned a value.

Behavioral Modifications:\n   - Updating version numbers for dependencies in multiple pom.xml files (e.g., jetty, jackson, slf4j). These updates may affect the functionality of the projects by introducing new features or bug fixes.\n   - Changing the implementation of some methods in AdminServlet and AdminServletTest classes to use Mockito's when() function instead of context.getContextPath(). This change is likely intended to simplify testing by mocking the ServletContext object.\n\n2. Structural Modifications:\n   - Adding a new property \"serviceName\" to AdminServlet class, which may affect how the servlet interacts with other components.\n   - Changing the access modifier of some methods and variables in AdminServlet and AdminServletTest classes from private to protected or public, which could impact encapsulation and visibility within the codebase.\n   - Updating import statements in various files to include new dependencies or classes.\n\nTechnical Indicators:\n- Behavioral Modifications: High\n- Structural Modifications: Medium\n\nDiff Source: direct",

Modification of the `CalculatorKeyboardFragment` constructor to accept a `Vibrator` object as an argument, which is used to create vibration effects when dragging buttons.\n3. Changes in the implementation of the `OnDragListener` for various buttons to handle different actions such as history navigation, operator selection, and cursor movement.\n4. Addition of a new method `toggleButtonDirectionText` to control whether direction text is shown on certain buttons.\n\nThe structural changes include:\n\n1. Extraction of the common code for setting up drag listeners into a separate method `setOnDragListeners`.\n2. Refactoring of some existing methods (e.g., `initMultiplicationButton`) to use the new `getButton` method.\n3. Changes in the layout handling, with the use of Fragments instead of adding views directly to the activity's layout.\n\nThe technical indicators for this diff are:\n- Behavioral changes: 4 (addition of a new method, modification of constructor, changes in OnDragListener implementation, addition of a new method to control button direction text)\n- Structural changes: 3 (extraction of common code, refactoring existing methods, changes in layout handling)",
