```

### 1.2 Core Implementation Highlights

#### LLM Communication Pipeline

The heart of the system is the optimized LLM handler that manages communication with Ollama:

```python
# [optimized_llm_handler.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/18)
class OptimizedLLMHandler:
    def analyze_commit(self, repository: str, commit1: str, commit2: str, 
                      commit_message: str, diff: str, show_prompt: bool = False):
        # 1. Model health check
        hc = check_llm_model_status(self.model, verbose=False)
        if not hc.get("available"):
            print(warning(f"Model '{self.model}' may not be ready"))
        
        # 2. Diff size management for large commits
        original_diff = diff
        reduced_meta = {}
        if len(diff) > 60000:  # 60KB threshold
            diff, reduced_meta = reduce_diff(diff)
            if reduced_meta.get("reduced"):
                print(warning(f"Diff reduced from {reduced_meta['original_chars']} "
                            f"to {reduced_meta['new_chars']} chars"))
        
        # 3. Dynamic context window adjustment
        ctx = dynamic_num_ctx(diff)
        
        # 4. Prompt construction with file support for large diffs
        prompt, diff_file_path = build_optimized_commit_prompt_with_file_support(
            {**commit_data, "diff": diff}, self.llm_prompt)
        
        # 5. LLM inference
        llm_response = self.adapter.complete(prompt, num_ctx=ctx)
        
        # 6. Multi-stage response processing
        result = self._process_llm_response(llm_response, commit_message, 
                                          commit_hash, previous_hash, repository, prompt)
        
        return result
```

#### Multi-Stage Error Recovery System

The system implements a sophisticated error recovery mechanism:

```python
# src/handlers/optimized_llm_handler.py
def _process_llm_response(self, llm_response: str, commit_message: str, ...):
    raw_response = llm_response.strip()
    
    # Stage 1: FINAL: pattern extraction (highest priority)
    final_classification = self._extract_final_classification(llm_response)
    if final_classification:
        print(success(f"Classification via FINAL: {final_classification}"))
        return {
            'repository': repository or 'Unknown',
            'commit_hash_before': previous_hash or 'Unknown',
            'commit_hash_current': commit_hash or 'Unknown',
            'refactoring_type': final_classification.lower(),
            'justification': raw_response,
            'extraction_method': 'final_pattern'
        }
    
    # Stage 2: JSON parsing with repair attempts
    json_result = extract_json_from_text(llm_response)
    
    # Stage 3: Fallback to text analysis
    if not json_result:
        print(warning("JSON parsing failed. Extracting from text..."))
        json_result = self._extract_analysis_from_raw_text(raw_response)
    
    # Stage 4: Retry with simplified prompt
    if not json_result and commit_hash and prompt:
        print(dim("Trying retry with simplified prompt"))
        retry_result = self._retry_analysis_with_simplified_prompt(
            commit_hash, previous_hash, repository, prompt)
        if retry_result:
            json_result = retry_result
    
    # Stage 5: Complete failure handling
    if not json_result:
        error_msg = "Unable to extract valid JSON after all attempts"
        self.save_json_failure(commit_hash, repository, commit_message, 
                              llm_response, error_msg, prompt_excerpt=prompt[:2000])
        return None
    
    return json_result
```

#### Git Operations and Repository Management

```python
# src/handlers/git_handler.py
class GitHandler:
    def get_commit_diff(self, repo_path, commit1, commit2):
        """Extract diff between two commits with error handling."""
        try:
            result = subprocess.run([
                'git', 'diff', f'{commit1}..{commit2}', 
                '--no-merges', '--unified=3'
            ], cwd=repo_path, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=30)
            
            if result.returncode != 0:
                print(error(f"Git diff failed: {result.stderr}"))
                return None
            
            return result.stdout
        except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
            print(error(f"Git diff timeout for {commit1}..{commit2}"))
            return None
        except Exception as e:
            print(error(f"Git diff error: {str(e)}"))
            return None
    
    def ensure_repo_cloned(self, repo_url):
        """Clone repository if not present locally."""
        repo_path = self._get_repo_local_path(repo_url)
        if not os.path.exists(repo_path):
            try:
                subprocess.run(['git', 'clone', repo_url, repo_path], 
                             check=True, timeout=300)
                print(success(f"Repository cloned: {repo_url}"))
            except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
                print(error(f"Clone timeout: {repo_url}"))
                return False
        return True
```

### 1.3 Prompt Engineering for Classification

The system uses carefully engineered prompts optimized for refactoring classification:

```text
# configs/PROMPT_OTIMIZADO_ATUAL.txt
You are an expert software engineering analyst specializing in distinguishing 
between pure and floss refactoring patterns. You will analyze Git diffs to 
classify commits with high precision.

## CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA

- Pure refactoring: "Pure refactoring is used for strictly improving the source 
  code structure and consists of pure refactoring."

- Floss refactoring: "Floss refactoring consists of refactoring the code together 
  with non-structural changes as a means to reach other goals, such as adding 
  features or removing bugs."

### PURE REFACTORING (structural changes only):
- Code reorganization without behavior changes
- Variable/method/class renaming that preserves semantics
- Method extraction that creates identical functionality
- Code movement between classes/packages without logic changes
- Formatting and style improvements

### FLOSS REFACTORING (mixed structural + functional changes):
- ANY addition of new functionality during restructuring
- Bug fixes combined with code reorganization
- Changes to method signatures that affect behavior
- Modification of return values or exception handling
- Addition/removal of parameters that change behavior

## ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

**Step 1: Diff Assessment**
- Large diffs: Focus on method signatures, new classes, and logic changes
- Small diffs: Analyze every change for behavioral impact

**Step 2: Change Pattern Recognition**
- Look for method signature changes beyond simple renames
- Identify any new conditional statements or loops
- Check for modified return statements or exception handling
- Assess parameter additions/removals for functional impact

**Step 3: Evidence-Based Classification**
- FLOSS: If ANY functional change is detected
- PURE: Only if ALL changes are purely structural

## RESPONSE FORMAT
{
    "refactoring_type": "pure|floss",
    "justification": "Technical analysis citing specific evidence",
    "confidence_level": "high|medium|low"
}
```

## 3. Information Flow Description

### 3.1 System Pipeline Overview

```
Input Data → Git Processing → LLM Analysis → Result Aggregation → Comparison Analysis
     ↓              ↓             ↓               ↓                    ↓
CSV Files    →  Diff Extract  →  Ollama API  →  JSON/CSV Save  →  Statistical Reports
```

### 3.2 Detailed Processing Phases

#### Phase 1: Data Preparation and Validation
1. **Load commit pairs** from `commits_with_refactoring.csv`
2. **Cross-reference** with PurityChecker results in `hashes_no_rpt_purity.csv`
3. **Filter valid commits** (both hashes exist and accessible)
4. **Identify unanalyzed commits** to avoid duplicate processing
5. **Create analysis queues** organized by priority and model

#### Phase 2: Git Operations and Diff Extraction
1. **Repository availability check** - ensure all target repos are accessible
2. **Clone missing repositories** with timeout and retry logic
3. **Commit validation** - verify both commit hashes exist
4. **Diff extraction** using [git diff commit1..commit2](http://_vscodecontentref_/20)
5. **Large diff handling** - reduce size if >60KB while preserving semantics

#### Phase 3: LLM Classification Pipeline
1. **Model health check** - verify Ollama availability and model status
2. **Prompt construction** - build optimized prompts with diff content
3. **Context window management** - adjust based on diff size
4. **API request execution** - send to Ollama with retry logic
5. **Response capture** - handle timeouts and connection issues

#### Phase 4: Response Processing and Recovery
1. **Primary parsing** - attempt JSON extraction from LLM response
2. **Pattern extraction** - look for FINAL: PURE/FLOSS patterns
3. **Text analysis fallback** - extract classification from natural language
4. **Retry mechanisms** - simplified prompts for persistent failures
5. **Failure logging** - comprehensive error tracking for debugging

#### Phase 5: Result Aggregation and Analysis
1. **Individual result storage** - save to model-specific directories
2. **CSV updates** - add analysis columns to main datasets
3. **Session logging** - detailed statistics and performance metrics
4. **Backup creation** - preserve previous versions before modifications
5. **Aggregated reporting** - combine results across models for comparison

### 3.3 Error Handling and Resilience

**Network-Level Resilience**:
- Connection timeout: 30 seconds default with exponential backoff
- Session reset after 5 consecutive failures
- Health check before each analysis batch
- Automatic model switching if primary unavailable

**Response Processing Robustness**:
- Multi-pattern classification extraction (FINAL:, JSON, text analysis)
- JSON repair for common formatting issues
- Confidence scoring based on extraction method
- Manual review flagging for ambiguous cases

**Data Integrity Measures**:
- Atomic CSV updates with rollback capability
- Backup creation before modifications
