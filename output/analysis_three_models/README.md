This folder contains the generated report for the three-model analysis (deepseek, mistral, gemma).

Files:
- report.html: interactive HTML report with plots (coverage, prediction distributions, confusion matrices) generated by `scripts/generate_three_model_report.py`.
- summary_three_models.csv: aggregated summary table used in the report.

How to regenerate:
1. Ensure dependencies are installed: pandas and plotly

   python3 -m pip install pandas plotly

2. Run the generator script from repository root:

   python3 scripts/generate_three_model_report.py

The script expects the CSV files under `csv/llm_analysis_csv/` and the aggregated CSV `csv/llm_analysis_aggregated.csv` and optional JSON `output/llm_purity_aggregated.json` to exist in the repository.
