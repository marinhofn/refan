The changes include renaming 'category' to 'logger', which does not affect the functionality, and adding a new test case for handling CDATA sections in log messages. This can be considered as a refactoring aimed at improving readability and maintaining code organization, without impacting the overall system functionality.",False,https://github.com/apache/log4j,"The commit of 1.2branch with the trunk. Things seem to have went
relatively well. Conflicts were quickly resolved. The resulting code

This refactoring does not affect the code's output or logic.,False,https://github.com/apache/log4j,"- Internal logging is now on even after a LogManager.resetConfiguration.
(Temporary code. All this will be radically changed when Domains enter 
the scene.)

- PropertySetter.setProperties method no longer activates the options 
of OptionHandlers. This results in slighly less confusing code. 
Changed ProppertyConfigurator to take thismodification  into account.

- Renamed test cases from XTestCase to XTest where X varies.
