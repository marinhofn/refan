The changes appear to be mostly structural modifications, with some behavioral changes as well.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n1. The changes are made to multiple files related to the Autopsy platform, indicating a broader scope of modification.\n2. The use of comments and TODO tags suggests that these changes are part of ongoing development or maintenance work.\n3. The presence of RJCTODO tags indicates that certain parts of the code require further attention or refactoring.\n4. The addition of a new method `submitFilesForIngest` in several files suggests a behavioral change related to file processing and submission for further analysis within Autopsy.\n\nClassification:\n```json\n{\n  \"diff_source\": \"direct\",\n  \"behavioral_changes\": [\"new method for submitting files for ingest\"],\n  \"structural_changes\": [\"modifications to multiple files related to the Autopsy platform\"]\n}\n```",

New classes have been added for `FixedAnnuityDefinitionBuilder` and `FloatingAnnuityDefinitionBuilder`, which are used to create fixed and floating rate annuities respectively. These classes extend an abstract class `AbstractAnnuityDefinitionBuilder`.\n\n2.

It also generates compounded or non-compounded floating rate flows based on the compounding method specified.\n\n3. Structural modifications:\n   - New classes have been added for various types of payment definitions such as `CouponFixedCompoundingDefinition`, `CouponIborCompoundingDefinition`, etc., which represent the individual coupons in an annuity.\n   - The code includes methods for generating schedules of start and end dates for the annuity, adjusting dates based on business conventions, and calculating year fractions.\n\n4.
