In the `BufferedMessageHandler`, a return statement is added to handle exceptions that might occur during message processing, but this doesn't affect the overall functionality of the handler.\n  4. The sleep time in the test case (TestRelay) is increased from 4000ms to 6000ms, which may be related to testing purposes rather than changing the program's behavior.\n\nOverall, these changes seem to be focused on improving code readability and maintainability without affecting the program's functionality.\"\n}",
