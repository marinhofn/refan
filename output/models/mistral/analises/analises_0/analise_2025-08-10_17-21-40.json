The changes include renaming 'category' to 'logger', which does not affect the functionality, and adding a new test case for handling CDATA sections in log messages. This can be considered as a refactoring aimed at improving readability and maintaining code organization, without impacting the overall system functionality.",

        "justification": "The changes in the commit primarily involve adding a new class (SunReflectFilter) and including it in various filters. However, this addition does not seem to alter the existing functionality of the code as it is being added as an optional filter. Existing filters remain unchanged, and there are no evident behavior or output modifications. Therefore, it appears to be a 'pure' refactoring.",
