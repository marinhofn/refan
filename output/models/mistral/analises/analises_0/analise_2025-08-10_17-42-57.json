        "justification": "The commit introduces changes that are purely structural in nature. In the Ruby file, the operating system name is standardized to 'Windows' instead of 'Windows XP'. This change does not affect functionality because both versions of the OS name will still produce the same results when used for translating directories and checking for cygpath. The Java file includes a new method unifyOSName that standardizes the operating system name to 'Windows', but it is not called anywhere in the code, so it has no effect on behavior or functionality. Therefore, this commit represents pure refactoring.",
        "commit_message": "If OS name starts with \"Windows\", we'll assume it's simply windows."
