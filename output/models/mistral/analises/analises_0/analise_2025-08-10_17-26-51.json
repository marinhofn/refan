        "justification": "In this commit, the code refactoring involves replacing a block of code that creates a TestCase instance using reflection with a call to a static method `getClassInstance(className)` in another class `JUnitSampler`. This change simplifies the code by removing instances of `Class.forName`, `Constructor`, and `newInstance`. Additionally, the new method also handles both constructor scenarios (empty and string constructor) as compared to the old approach which only attempted to create an instance using the empty constructor initially. However, this refactoring does not change any behavior or functionality of the code, making it a 'pure' refactoring.",

If a class does\neither case, the sampler will log it and attempt to create a new instance with\nstring constructor. if both fail, it isn't a valid JUnit test.\npeter\n\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/jmeter/trunk@325582 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68\n\nFormer-commit-id: fc4bba760eb1163b6d15a2ed1af5706580644319"
