        "justification": "In this commit, there are no observable changes to the behavior or functionality of the code. The refactoring seems focused on reorganizing and simplifying conditional logic in various methods without altering their outcomes (e.g., removing unnecessary if-else statements, replacing them with ternary operators). Additionally, there is an introduction of new methods but no changes to their existing counterparts that could affect behavior. Therefore, this commit can be classified as 'pure' refactoring.",
        "commit_message": "Removed duplication, updated to use foreach arrays\n\nMay have slightly improved performance for long-lived visualizations,\nneed to do some comparisons."
