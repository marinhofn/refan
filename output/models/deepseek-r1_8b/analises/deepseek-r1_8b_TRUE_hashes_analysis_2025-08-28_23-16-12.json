This suggests that the application is being internationalized by providing multiple language versions of email templates.\n\nHowever, note that:\n- The changes are primarily structural: adding new fields and methods for handling emails in different languages.\n- There's no evidence of any change in functionality (behavior) regarding FLOSS or non-FLOSS status because these files were deleted but their content is now handled by the renamed views.
