It no longer requires multiple lines of code for the same purpose.\n\n3. **Code Clarity**: By combining the two parameters into one, the code becomes more concise and easier to understand.\n\n4. **Maintainability**: This change makes the class more maintainable as it reduces the number of lines of code that need to be written and reviewed.\n\n5. **Readability**: The simplified constructor improves readability by grouping related information together.\n\n6. **Documentation**: The documentation for the `symbolicName` field has been updated to reflect the new parameter name, ensuring accurate documentation.\n\nThis change makes the class more efficient and easier to work with while maintaining its purpose of retrieving properties from a file object.",
