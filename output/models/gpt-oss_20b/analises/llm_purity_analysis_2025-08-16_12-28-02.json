      "llm_justification": "The diff introduces a new public API method `listEnvironmentNodes` in `ChefApi`, which expands the observable behavior of the API by allowing callers to retrieve environment nodes. This is a clear addition of functionality. Additionally, the removal of custom binder classes (`BindClientnameToJsonPayload`, `BindIsCompletedToJsonPayload`, `BindNameToJsonPayload`) and the replacement of their usage with the `@WrapWith` annotation changes how request payloads are constructed, potentially altering request semantics. New tests are added to exercise this new method, further indicating a functional change. No purely structural changes are sufficient to cover all modifications; the presence of new behavior makes this a FLOSS refactoring.",
