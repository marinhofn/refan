It's not a simple refactoring; it's a *structural modification* of the class's core functionality.  Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **`RowRecord` and `RowRecordsAggregate`:** The core of the change is the introduction of a `RowRecord` class. This class is responsible for storing the row data and its associated metadata.  The `RowRecordsAggregate` class now holds a `RowRecord` instance.\n\n2. **`getRowBlockCount()`:** This method is updated to return the number of rows within a block. This is a crucial change. The original `RowRecordsAggregate` had a `size` field that tracked the total number of rows.  The new version uses the `RowRecord` instance to determine the number of rows within a block.\n\n3. **`getRowBlockSize(int block)`:** This method is updated to return the size of a block.\n\n4. **`getStartRowNumberForBlock(int block)`:** This method is updated to return the number of rows in a block.\n\n5. **`getRowCountForBlock(int block)`:** This method is updated to return the number of rows within a block.\n\n6. **`getStartRowNumberForBlock(int block)`:** This method is updated to return the number of rows in a block.\n\n7. **`getLastRowNumberForBlock(int block)`:** This method is updated to return the number of rows in a block.\n\n8. **`getLastRowNumberForBlock(int block)`:** This method is updated to return the number of rows in a block.\n\n9. **`getRowBlockCount()`:** This method is updated to return the number of rows within a block.\n\n10. **`getRowBlockSize(int block)`:** This method is updated to return the size of a block.\n\n11. **`getStartRowNumberForBlock(int block)`:** This method is updated to return the number of rows in a block.\n\n12. **`getLastRowNumberForBlock(int block)`:** This method is updated to return the number of rows in a block.\n\n13. **`getLastRowNumberForBlock(int block)`:** This method is updated to return the number of rows in a block.\n\n14. **`getRowCountForBlock(int block)`:** This method is updated to return the number of rows within a block.\n\n15. **`getStartRowNumberForBlock(int block)`:** This method is updated to return the number of rows in a block.\n\n16. **`getLastRowNumberForBlock(int block)`:** This method is updated to return the number of rows in a block.\n\n17. **`getRowRecord`:** The `RowRecord` class is now a member of the `RowRecordsAggregate` class.\n\n**Key Changes and Implications:**\n\n*   **Data Organization:** The code now explicitly manages row data and metadata through the `RowRecord` class.\n*   **Block-Based Processing:** The `getRowBlockCount()` and `getRowBlockSize()` methods are now tied to the concept of blocks, which is a fundamental aspect of data processing in many systems.\n*   **Increased Complexity:** The introduction of the `RowRecord` and the associated methods significantly increases the complexity of the code.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"diff_source\": \"direct\"\n}\n```\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a significant change that alters the core functionality of the class. It's a structural modification, indicating a shift in the design and potentially a change in the class's purpose.  The code has been modified to incorporate a new data structure and a new method to manage row data.",

It replaces the `MeetingActor` with a `SimplePollResultOutVO` which encapsulates the poll result data.  The core logic for displaying the poll result is now handled within the `SimplePollResultOutVO`’s `showPollResult` method.  This is a substantial refactoring, moving away from the complex `MeetingActor` to a more streamlined and maintainable structure.\n\n**Key Changes & Implications:**\n\n* **Simplified Data Structure:** The `SimplePollResultOutVO` now holds the necessary data (poll ID, poll result, page number) in a single, well-defined structure.\n* **Improved Readability:** The code is more concise and easier to understand.\n* **Potential for Future Expansion:**  The `SimplePollResultOutVO` can be extended to include more complex poll data (e.g., user information, vote counts).\n* **Dependency on `SimplePollResultRequest`:** The code now relies on a `SimplePollResultRequest` to determine how to display the poll result. This is a good design choice, as it decouples the display logic from the poll data itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis change represents a significant improvement in the design of the `PollApp` class. It's a well-structured and maintainable refactoring that enhances the code's readability and potential for future development.
