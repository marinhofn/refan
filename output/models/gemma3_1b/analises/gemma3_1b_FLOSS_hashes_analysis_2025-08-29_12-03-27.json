These are new functions that are intended to be called by the `FunctionsResolver` to perform specific operations.  The code is structured to handle the `FunctionsResolver` and the `FunctionName` to ensure that the correct function is called.  The `TokenFunction` is a special case, as it is the only function whose argument types depend on the table on which the function is called.  The code also includes a `ConcurrentHashMap` to store the declared functions, which is a good practice for managing function names.  The code also includes a `declare` statement to make the functions available.  The diff is a straightforward addition of new functions to the `Functions` class.  The code is well-formatted and easy to understand.",
